The main goal is to support what people may have laying around or have easy access to. EVA is trying to implement that goal. The specification is described in a separate EVA 2 / spec document. Parts explained \u00b6 The Bowden variant is the parent of all other drive variants in EVA 2. The main parts ( sub assemblies ) of EVA 2 are: front - which changes based on the choosen hotend, e.g. E3D V6 vs a Mosquito. top - specified by the preferred drive - in this case there is no drive as for a bowden assembly a 3 rd party drive is on the frame. back - different for motion systems - CoreXY is the default. bottom - mainly serves the purpose of being a proxy to a fan duct. Then there are auxilary parts: fan duct , belt grabbers , belt tensioners , probe holders , cable guides and shrouds . Download \u00b6 The whole package can be downloaded as a ZIP package, otherwise you can navigate to the the specific drive or addon page and download files from there. Download Support \u00b6 Big thanks to the users - one example is that only thanks to your donations the Mosquito parts were possible. If you want to support the project or just buy me coffee you can Paypal.me . The project also received or receives continuous support from the companies we all know. Big thank you! Please go and buy something from them Issues \u00b6 Issues, problems, feature requests, requests for compatibility with different printers can be requested in the project's issue tracker . Attributions \u00b6 One does not need a keen eye to see that this design is based on many different designs that are out in the wild - although all the parts here are made from scratch - their authors deserve credit (their work provided inspiration): Rat Rig for making the V-core which is the perfect sanbox for building and modding a 3D Printer pekcitron for the Prusa Bear Upgrade BLV and his amazing BLV mgn cube The following people deserve special credit for their amazing work - making some of the parts, providing guidance, testing parts, keeping me in check.

Infill should not be less than 20% rectilinear. Most of the parts can be printed with 0.3 layer height but 0.2 is the safe bet. Printing orientation \u00b6 The parts are not oriented in the print orientation. I am currently unavailable to maintain that but the rule is: find a big flat face and set it on the bed. Supports \u00b6 Unless specified the parts require no supports . If your print orientation required supports then you oriented the part wrong :) Handling hex nuts \u00b6 To properly insert a hex nut into a printed part you need to take a short screw, thread it through the hole, put the nut in, drive the nut untill it's properly sitting in it's place and finally remove the short screw. This is very important and will allow for the nut not to bind in the screw threads when you are mid-way through your assembly - when a nut binds the two parts are usually garbage and need to be reprinted. Pokey Pokey hole technique \u00b6 When looking at the files or when slicing you will find that the holes are not there that is by design and while I know there are many techiques for achieving proper mid-air holes I am not able to consume the amount of work required to implement that for every single hole or sometimes there's not enough room for that. There are 0.2 - 0.3 layers covering the holes to \"trick\" the slicer into thinking there is a bridge to be made. After printing you need to either drill, poke with a screw driver, allen key or even force the screw throuh that layer - all of the above works (drill being the fastest obviously). You can see the blue spots (bridges) around the belt teeth are covering the holes fully.","title":"Printing"},{"location":"printing/#printing-orientation","text":"The parts are not oriented in the print orientation.
